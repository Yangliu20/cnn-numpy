# cnn-numpy
This project builds a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits in MNIST datasets. The code presents an end-to-end machine learning process, including image preprocessing, model definition, model training, model validation and inference. Forward propagation and backward propagation are written from scratch using pure numpy.
